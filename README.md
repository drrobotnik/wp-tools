# WordPress tools
========

A fork of [linepress WP-Tools](https://github.com/linepress/wp-tools).

The main difference is that I minimize extra config folders and files. And add options local and production options. The project is very customizable.

# Requirements and Assumptions
This script assumes you're using OSX and WP-CLI. WP-CLI itself doesn't work well with MAMP out of the box, so if you're using homebrew or a self compiled set-up of PHP/MYSQL you'll probably be fine.

# Usage
Execute in terminal
`setup.sh` and follow the instructions.
